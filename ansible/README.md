Ansible playbooks for provisioning and depoying to a Rails webserver

## Setup

1. Run `ansible-galaxy install rvm_io.rvm1-ruby`
2. Clone this repository as subfolder called `ansible` under your Rails app folder.
3. Create a file named `production` (no extension) at the root of the `ansible` folder with the IP address of the server to provision.  There is a `production.example` file in this repository that can serve as a template for what the file should look like.
